Iterator (based on Java Iterator)

Intent:
  - sequentially access the elements of a collection without revealing or
    exposing the collection interface and/or representation

Structure:
  - define/use Iterable<T> interface with two methods:
     - hasNext    there are not-yet-iterated elements
     - next       returns a not-yet-iterated element
  - the iterator class is preferably encapsulated
  - iterator object is produced by method "iterator()"

Notes:
  - Beware of changing the collection during an iteration
