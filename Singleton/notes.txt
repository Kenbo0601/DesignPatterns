***** Singleton *****

*All objects that use an instance of that class use the same instance

Structure:
 -  private static variable to hold the only instance
 -  private constructor
 -  static method to return the instance

class MySingleton {

     //private static variable that points to the only instance of this class
     private static MySingleton theInstance = new MySingleton();

     //private constructor to restrict instantiation to this class only
     private MySingleton(){}

     //needs to be static so this can get called from outside of this class
     static MySingleton getInstance(){
         return theInstance;
     }
 }
